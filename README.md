#maze

##Description

*maze* is a small maze-solving game written in Haskell to test out mtl's
State and StateT monads. More than anything else, this is a learning
project, so do not expect the game to be extensively feature-filled.
Simultaniously, though, it should be at least resonably playable.

##Installation

```bash
>$ git clone https://github.com/Crockeo/maze.git
>$ cd maze
>$ cabal sandbox init # Optional
>$ cabal install
>$ dist/build/maze/maze # Running the program
```
